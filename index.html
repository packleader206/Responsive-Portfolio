                    My name is Al Young and I am currently enrolled as a student in UW's coding bootcamp.  I graduated from the University of Washington in 1993 with
                    a Bachelor of Arts in Communications with a concentration in PR.  After graduation, through self study, I acquired my Microsoft Certified Professional
                    certifications in several disciplines under the Windows NT Platform.  With these certifications, I embarked on a career as a network professional. 
                    Initially, I worked on a contract basis as a networking consultant, completing jobs for the Pemco Financial & Weyerhauser, before ending up at the Metropolitan
                    King County Council as a contracted Network Support Agent. After a period of time, I was hired on as the full-time Network Administrator for the King 
                    County Council.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    After working for about 5 yrs for the King County Council, I decided to embark on an adventure and moved to Colorado, where I spent two years pursuing 
                    my passion for snowboarding. I spent one season at Winter Park & one season at Copper Mountain.  This was an incredibly enjoyable time in my life and a
                    nice respite, but not really a sustainable lifestyle financially.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    From Colorado, I decided to settle in Chicago at which time I decided to go into small business for myself.  I opened up the first Dog Daycare in the
                    Western Suburbs of Chicago.  I built up an amazing client base and brought the business to profitability in the first year.  After owning/running the business
                    for 3 years, I was approached by two different parties with competing offers to buy my business.  At the time, I was already of the mindset that I would either sell 
                    the business or expand with more locations/services.  Because of the competing offers, the right decision for me at the time was to go ahead and sell the business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    After I sold my business, I became a licensed real estate broker in the state of Illinois.  I sold and invested in, residential and commercial real estate at RE/MAX of
                    Naperville & Charles Rutenberg Realty.  This continued for the better part of a decade before moving back to the Seattle area.  My enrollment in UW Coding
                    bootcamp is hopefully, the beginning of my transition back into a tech-industry job, and the start of my career as a full-stack web developer.
