      <p> My name is Al Young and I am currently enrolled as a student in UW's coding bootcamp.  I graduated from the University of Washington in 1993 with
        a Bachelor of Arts in Communications with a concentration in PR.  After graduation, through self study, I acquired my Microsoft Certified Professional
        certifications in several disciplines under the Windows NT Platform.  With these certifications, I embarked on a career as a network professional. 
        Initially, I worked on a contract basis as a networking consultant, completing jobs for the Pemco Financial & Weyerhauser, before ending up at the Metropolitan
        King County Council as a contracted Network Support Agent. After a period of time, I was hired on as the full-time Network Administrator for the King 
        County Council.</p>

      <p>After 5 years with the Metropolitan King County Council, I moved to Colorado and then to Chicago.  During this time I transitioned out of tech-industry work
        and started my own small business as well as sold and invested in resdidential and commercial real estate.  My enrollment in the UW Coding
        bootcamp is hopefully, the beginning of my transition back into a tech-industry job, and the start of my career as a full-stack web developer.</p>
